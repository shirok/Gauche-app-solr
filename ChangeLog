	* app/solr.scm (solr-query): API Change (INCOMPATIBLE): Instead of
	  giving result-type to solr-query, we provide a separate utiltiy
	  functions to extract desired information from the entire sxml
	  returned from solr-query.  Since there's no way to disable
	  pagenation of the solr-query results, the caller always need to
	  check the response count.  Thus merely taking doc nodes and
	  discarding other information isn't feasible.
	* app/solr.scm (solr-result->response-count, solr-result->doc-nodes,
	  solr-result->doc-alist): The utility functions to extract info
	  from the result of solr-query.
